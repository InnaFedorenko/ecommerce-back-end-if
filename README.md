#### Internet retail, also known as **e-commerce**, is the largest sector of the electronics industry, generating an estimated $29 trillion in 2019. E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes. Due to their prevalence, understanding the fundamental architecture of these platforms will benefit you as a full-stack web developer.
### User Story

```md
AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies
```

### Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
```

## Specification
### Database Models

Your database should contain the following four models, including the requirements listed for each model:

* `Category`

  * `id`

    * Integer.
  
    * Doesn't allow null values.
  
    * Set as primary key.
  
    * Uses auto increment.

  * `category_name`
  
    * String.
  
    * Doesn't allow null values.

* `Product`

  * `id`
  
    * Integer.
  
    * Doesn't allow null values.
  
    * Set as primary key.
  
    * Uses auto increment.

  * `product_name`
  
    * String.
  
    * Doesn't allow null values.

  * `price`
  
    * Decimal.
  
    * Doesn't allow null values.
  
    * Validates that the value is a decimal.

  * `stock`
  
    * Integer.
  
    * Doesn't allow null values.
  
    * Set a default value of `10`.
  
    * Validates that the value is numeric.

  * `category_id`
  
    * Integer.
  
    * References the `Category` model's `id`.

* `Tag`

  * `id`
  
    * Integer.
  
    * Doesn't allow null values.
  
    * Set as primary key.
  
    * Uses auto increment.

  * `tag_name`
  
    * String.

* `ProductTag`

  * `id`

    * Integer.

    * Doesn't allow null values.

    * Set as primary key.

    * Uses auto increment.

  * `product_id`

    * Integer.

    * References the `Product` model's `id`.

  * `tag_id`

    * Integer.

    * References the `Tag` model's `id`.

### Associations

You'll need to execute association methods on your Sequelize models to create the following relationships between them:

* `Product` belongs to `Category`, and `Category` has many `Product` models, as a category can have multiple products but a product can only belong to one category.

* `Product` belongs to many `Tag` models, and `Tag` belongs to many `Product` models. Allow products to have multiple tags and tags to have many products by using the `ProductTag` through model.

##  Installation
1. Youâ€™ll need to use the [MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) and [Sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize) packages to connect your Express.js API to a MySQL database and the [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) package to use environment variables to store sensitive data.
run `npm i` to install packages
2. Use the `schema.sql` file in the `db` folder to create your database with MySQL shell commands. 
3. Use environment variables to store sensitive data like your MySQL username, password, and database name (create `.env` file based on your credentials, use `.env.Example` as a reference).
4. Run `npm run seed` to seed data to your database so that you can test your routes.

##  Usage
1. Use `node server` to start the application server (use `npx nodemon server`to debug)
2. Import [API collection](insomnia/ecommerce_backend_if_insomnia.json) and open in the [Insomnia](https://docs.insomnia.rest/insomnia/install) tool
3. Select request and run
